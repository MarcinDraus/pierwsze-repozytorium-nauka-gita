    <h2>Survivor - Eye of the tiger</h2>
    <p>Risin' up, back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet Just a man
        and his will to survive So many times, it happens too fast You change your passion for glory Don't lose your
        grip on the dreams of the past You must fight just to keep them alive Chorus: It's the eye of the tiger, it's
        the thrill of the fight Risin' up to the challenge of our rival And the last known survivor stalks his prey in
        the night And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger Face to face, out in the heat Hangin' tough,
        stayin' hungry They stack the odds 'till we take to the street For we kill with the skill to survive Chorus:
        It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight Risin' up to the challenge of our rival And the last
        known survivor stalks his prey in the night And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger Risin' up,
        straight to the top Have the guts, got the glory Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop Just a man and his
        will to survive Chorus: It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight Risin' up to the challenge of
        our rival And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the
        tiger The eye of the tiger (repeats out).</p>
